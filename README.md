Hello everyone,

I developed this game with C++Builder for the Minesweeper Programming Challenge. My game introduces a unique feature for the first time: the use of Voronoi patterns in the layout of the game cells. In addition, any pattern that can be defined with polygons can be added to the game as a custom one or loaded at runtime.

Minesweeper is an exciting and exciting experience in the world of puzzle games that defines unique and new features.

The variety in gameplay is one of the strengths of this game. Players can choose from several different modes and get a different experience each time. This variety not only increases the appeal of the game, but also ensures that players face new challenges each time and prevents the game from becoming repetitive.

The attractive and diverse color scheme of the game also adds to its beauty. The use of related and harmonious colors provides a pleasant visual experience for players and makes each game look fresh and lively.

In addition, the new pattern in the arrangement of cells allows players to use different strategies to solve puzzles and find mines.

The game's user interface is uniquely designed. This modern, minimal, and user-friendly design allows players to easily engage with the game environment and allows them to fully focus on solving puzzles. The game's user interface is designed in a minimalist style and eliminates distracting elements so that players can focus on their main goal.

In addition to the classic quadrilateral pattern inspired by the original Windows version of the game and its dimensions can be adjusted, new and innovative patterns are introduced for the first time in the game that make the game completely unique from other similar versions. This idea came to my mind when I had played the original Windows game a lot and had learned all the modes and it was repetitive for me and I was thinking of various patterns that would present different polygons with random arrangements together. So I got to work and wrote my idea. I recommend that you definitely experience it.

Predefined patterns that include designs for products from the reputable Embarcadero company are included in the game, which both makes the game more attractive for programmers and invites and encourages ordinary people to enter the exciting world of programming.

In addition, polygonal patterns can be imported from outside the software.

Minesweeper is not just an ordinary puzzle game; it is an exciting journey into a world of challenges and puzzles that encourages each player to explore mines with creative and strategic thinking, while enjoying a unique experience.

I thank you in advance for your attention and support. And I hope you enjoy this game and that this game can play its small role in interacting with the C++ Builder and Delphi programming community and promote more communication and exchange of ideas in the RAD Studio programming community.
