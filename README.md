Hello everyone,

I have developed this game to participate in the Minesweeper programming challenge. My game introduces a unique feature for the first time: the use of Voronoi patterns in the arrangement of the game cells. Additionally, any pattern that can be defined with polygons can be custom-added to the game or loaded during runtime.
